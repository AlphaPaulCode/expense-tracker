Expense Tracker
Expense Tracker is a simple web application built with React that allows users to track their income and expenses. Users can add new transactions, view their balance, income, and expenses, and delete transactions as needed.

Features
Add Transaction: Users can add new transactions by entering a text description and the transaction amount. Transactions can be either income (positive amount) or expense (negative amount).

View Balance: The application displays the total balance of all transactions, calculated by summing the amounts of all transactions.

View Income and Expenses: Users can see the total income and expenses separately, providing a breakdown of their financial activities.

Delete Transaction: Users can delete individual transactions from the list if they wish to remove them.

Technologies Used
React: The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Context API: Global state management is handled using React Context API, allowing components to share data without passing props manually through each level of the component tree.

CSS: Basic CSS styles are applied to the components to provide a simple and clean user interface.
